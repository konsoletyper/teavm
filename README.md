## Building TeaVM

Simply clone source code (`git clone https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm.git`)
and run Gradle build (`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` or `gradlew.bat publishToMavenLocal`).
You should build samples separately, as described in [corresponding readme file](samples/README.md).


### Useful Gradle tasks

* `:tools:classlib-comparison-gen:build` &ndash; build Java class library compatibility report.
  result is available at: `tools/classlib-comparison-gen/build/jcl-support`


## Embedding TeaVM

If you are not satisfied with Maven, you can embed TeaVM in your program 
or even create your own plugin for any build tool, like Ant or Gradle.
The starting point for you may be `org.teavm.tooling.TeaVMTool` class from `teavm-tooling` artifact. 
You may want to go deeper and use `org.teavm.vm.TeaVM` from `teavm-core` artifact, learn how `TeaVMTool` initializes it. 
To learn how to use `TeaVMTool` class itself, find its usages across project source code. 
You most likely encounter Maven and IDEA plugins.
  
Please, notice that these APIs for embedding are still unstable and may change between versions.


## WebAssembly

WebAssembly support is in experimental status. It may lack major features available in JavaScript backend. 
There's no documentation yet, and you should do many things by hands 
(like embedding generated `wasm` file into your page, importing JavaScript objects, etc).
Look at [samples/benchmark](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm/blob/master/samples/benchmark/) module.
You should first examine `pom.xml` file to learn how to build `wasm` file from Java.
Then you may want to examine `index-teavm.html` and `index-teavm.js`
to learn how to embed WebAssembly into your web page.
